# Life Expectancy Prediction Project

## Page Overview
This project predicts life expectancy based on various socio-economic and health factors using Polynomial Linear Regression. The workflow includes data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables), feature scaling, polynomial feature generation, model training, and evaluation.

## Tasks Completed
- Data cleaning and imputation of missing values  
- Conversion of boolean columns to integers  
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables  
- Splitting data into training and validation sets  
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler  
- Polynomial feature transformation (degree=2)  
- Training a Linear Regression model  
- Model evaluation with RÂ² score  
- Prediction on test data and creation of submission file
